# Introduction to Embedded Systems Software and Development Environments (Coursera)
# Assignment 1

This programming assignment creates a simple application that performs statistical analytics on a dataset.

The program analyzes an array of unsigned char data items and reports analytics on the maximum, minimum, mean, and median of the data set. In addition, it reorders this data set from large to small. All statistics round down to the nearest integer.
